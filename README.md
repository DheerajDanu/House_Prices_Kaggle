# 🏡 Housing Prices Prediction – Kaggle ML Project

This project is part of Kaggle’s *Getting Started* track. The goal is to build a regression model that can predict house sale prices based on various features from Ames, Iowa's housing dataset.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predict the final sale price of each house using 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.

## 🚀 What I Did
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data using **pandas** and **NumPy**
- Handled missing values and outliers
- Applied **Target Encoding** on categorical variables using `category_encoders`
- Built and trained a **Random Forest Regressor** using Scikit-Learn
- Evaluated model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

## 🔧 Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- category_encoders
- matplotlib, seaborn (for EDA, if used)

## 📁 Files Included
- `Housing_Price_Prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with the full workflow
- `README.md` – Overview of the project

## 📘 Resources
- 📓 Kaggle Notebook: [View on Kaggle][(https://www.kaggle.com/code/dheerajdanu07/housing-price)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dheerajdanu07/housing-prices)

## ✅ Key Learnings
- End-to-end data preprocessing
- Encoding categorical variables with target encoding
- Applying Random Forests to regression problems
- Interpreting model evaluation metrics like MSE

## 📈 Outcome
Successfully trained a Random Forest model to predict housing prices with decent accuracy. This project helped solidify my understanding of the machine learning pipeline using Scikit-Learn.

**Next Steps:** Experiment with other models like XGBoost and tune hyperparameters for better results.
